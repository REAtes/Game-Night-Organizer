# A Game Night Organizer

Welcome to the Sorcery Society Game Night Organizer! This Python project helps you automate the process of planning game nights at your comic book store, the Sorcery Society. Whether you're hosting an "Abruptly Goblins!" RPG night or any other game night, this tool will assist you in finding the best night for maximum attendance.

## Introduction

Opening your comic book store, the Sorcery Society, has been a lifelong dream come true. You quickly diversified your shop offerings to include miniatures, plush toys, collectible card games, and board games. Eventually, the store became more of a games store with a selection of this week's newest comic books and a small offering of graphic novel paperbacks. Completing your transformation means offering space for local tabletop gamers. They love to play their favorite RPG, "Abruptly Goblins!" and will happily pay you per chair to secure the space to do it. Unfortunately, planning the game night has fallen to you. If you pick the wrong night, not enough people will come, and the game night will be canceled. You decide it's best to automate the game night selector to get the most people through the door. First, you need to create a list of people who will be attending the game night.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Run the `game_night_organizer.py` script to organize and schedule your game nights.

## Usage

Here's how the Sorcery Society Game Night Organizer works:

1. The script allows you to create a list of gamers who are interested in attending game night.
2. It calculates the availability of each gamer and determines the best night for the game night.
3. You can then send email invitations to all gamers for the selected game night.

## Code Overview

The project is divided into the following sections:

1. **Creating Gamers**: You start by creating a list of gamers with their availability.

2. **Calculating Availability**: The script calculates the availability of each night and finds the best night for game night.

3. **Sending Invitations**: It sends email invitations to all gamers for the selected game night.

## Customize

You can customize the script to host different game nights or modify the email template to suit your preferences.
